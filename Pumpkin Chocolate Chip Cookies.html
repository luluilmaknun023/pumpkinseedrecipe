<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ingredients :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1/2 cup (1 stick or 115g) unsalted butter, melted &amp; slightly cooled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1/4 cup (50g) packed light or dark brown sugar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 6 Tablespoons (86g) pumpkin puree (see note).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1 and 1/2 cups (188g) all-purpose flour (spoon &amp; leveled).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1/4 teaspoon salt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1/2 cup (90g) semi-sweet chocolate chips, plus a few extra for the tops.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together in a medium bowl until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the vanilla and blotted pumpkin until smooth. Set aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft. &nbsp;Fold in 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. The chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them. Cover the dough and chill for 30 minutes or up to 3 days. Chilling the dough is imperative for this recipe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Remove dough from the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350&deg;F (177&deg;C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Roll the dough into balls, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough each. Using the back of a spoon, slightly flatten the tops of the dough balls. (Without doing so, the cookies may not spread.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear set. The cookies will look very soft in the center. Remove from the oven. If you find that your cookies didn&rsquo;t spread much at all, flatten them out with the back of a spoon when you take them out of the oven. If desired, press a few chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is only for looks!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. Cool cookies on the baking sheets for at least 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. &nbsp;The longer the cookies cool, the even better they taste! The flavor gets stronger and the texture becomes chewier. I usually let them sit, uncovered, for several hours before serving. Chewiness and pumpkin flavor are even stronger on day 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. <strong>Make Ahead &amp; Freezing Instructions:</strong> You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Allow to come to room temperature, then continue with step 3. Baked cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well up to 3 months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw. Here are my tips for how to freeze cookie dough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. <strong>Pumpkin:</strong> Squeeze as much of the moisture out of the pumpkin puree as you can before adding it to the cookie dough. I simply squeeze the puree with paper towels. See photo in the post for a visual. This will help produce a less cakey cookie. Less moisture is a good thing here! Measure 6 Tablespoons AFTER the pumpkin has been squeezed/blotted. Do not use pumpkin pie filling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3.<strong>&nbsp;Pumpkin Pie Spice:</strong> If desired, you can use 1/4 teaspoon each: ground nutmeg, ground allspice, and ground cloves instead of pumpkin pie spice. If doing so, don&rsquo;t leave out the cinnamon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4.<strong>&nbsp;Bigger Batch:</strong> Cookie recipe can easily be doubled by doubling each ingredient. Chill the cookie dough for 45 minutes.</p>
