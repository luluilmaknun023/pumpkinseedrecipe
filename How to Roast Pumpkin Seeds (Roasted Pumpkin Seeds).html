<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to Make Roasted Pumpkin Seeds?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Remove &amp; clean seeds&ndash; It starts with scooping the seeds from the pumpkin (we prefer sugar pumpkins which tend to yield smaller, crispier pumpkin seeds) and removing the stringy parts. Rinsing in a colander or fine mesh strainer helps remove any remaining goop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Dry seeds&ndash; Using a towel, dry the seeds thoroughly. This helps them crisp up in the oven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Add oil, salt, and seasonings&ndash; We like to use avocado oil in a ratio of 1 Tbsp oil to 1 cup seeds. Season with salt and add other seasonings (such as Shawarma, Curry Powder, or Pumpkin Pie Spice) for an extra boost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Bake&ndash; Bake for 20-30 minutes at 325 degrees, or until the pumpkin seeds are crisp and light golden brown. Smaller seeds will need less time than larger ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Let cool&ndash; As the seeds cool, they will crisp up a little more. Make sure to let them cool completely before transferring to a sealed container. Otherwise, they may get soggy from the steam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to Roast Pumpkin Seeds?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An easy, step-by-step tutorial for how to roast your own pumpkin seeds! Versatile with what seasonings you add, but crunchy and delicious every time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ingredients : </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;- ~1 cup pumpkin seeds from 1 sugar (pie) pumpkin (sugar pumpkins are best for yielding the crispiest roasted pumpkin seeds)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1 Tbsp avocado or melted coconut oil</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 1 healthy pinch sea salt</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Seasonings (such as Shawarma or Curry Powder // optional)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instructions :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (162 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or more if making a larger batch).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Scoop the seeds from your pumpkin and try and remove most of the stringy parts. Then place in a colander or fine mesh strainer and rinse thoroughly to remove any of the leftover goop from the pumpkin. (If using store bought, measure out seeds and place directly on baking sheet.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Arrange cleaned pumpkin seeds on a towel and dry thoroughly. This will help the pumpkin seeds crisp up in the oven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Arrange dried pumpkin seeds on baking sheet and drizzle with oil (~1 Tbsp / 15 ml per 1 cup / 64 g seeds). Add salt and any other desired seasonings (such as Shawarma or Curry), and toss to thoroughly coat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Bake for 20-30 minutes (this will depend on how big your seeds are), or until crisp and light golden brown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. Let cool completely before transferring to a sealed container, such as a mason jar. Will keep at room temperature for 1 week or more, or in the freezer up to 1 month.</p>
