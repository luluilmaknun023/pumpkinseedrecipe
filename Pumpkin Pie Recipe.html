<p>Fill a sweet shortcrust pastry tart case with lightly spiced squash to make a traditional American treat.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients :</strong></p>
<p>- 750g/1lb 10oz pumpkin or butternut squash, peeled, deseeded and cut into chunks.</p>
<p>- 350g sweet shortcrust pastry.</p>
<p>- Plain flour, for dusting.</p>
<p>- 140g caster sugar.</p>
<p>- &frac12; tsp salt.</p>
<p>- &frac12; tsp fresh nutmeg, grated.</p>
<p>- 1 tsp cinnamon.</p>
<p>- 2 eggs, beaten.</p>
<p>- 25g butter, melted.</p>
<p>- 175ml milk.</p>
<p>- 1 tbsp icing sugar.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Method :&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>1. Place the pumpkin in a large saucepan, cover with water and bring to the boil. Cover with a lid and simmer for 15 mins or until tender. Drain pumpkin; let cool.</p>
<p>2. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface and use it to line a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Chill for 15 mins. Line the pastry with baking parchment and baking beans, then bake for 15 mins. Remove the beans and paper, and cook for a further 10 mins until the base is pale golden and biscuity. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.</p>
<p>3. Increase oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Push the cooled pumpkin through a sieve into a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, salt, nutmeg and half the cinnamon. Mix in the beaten eggs, melted butter and milk, then add to the pumpkin pur&eacute;e and stir to combine. Pour into the tart shell and cook for 10 mins, then reduce the temperature to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Continue to bake for 35-40 mins until the filling has just set.</p>
<p>4. Leave to cool, then remove the pie from the tin. Mix the remaining cinnamon with the icing sugar and dust over the pie. Serve chilled.</p>
